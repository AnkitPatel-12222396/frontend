Frontend development involves crafting the user-facing portion of websites, utilizing three fundamental technologies:
1.HTML
2.CSS
3.JavaScript

HTML: This markup language provides the structure of a webpage, employing elements and tags to organize content.

CSS: Cascading Style Sheets enable the aesthetic customization of webpages, facilitating tasks such as adjusting spacing, color schemes, and element positioning.

JavaScript: This scripting language empowers the addition of interactive elements and enables dynamic responses to user actions, enhancing the overall user experience.
